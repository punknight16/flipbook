interpret-pic.js
	example:
		pic1 = '2x2 dot @ 12, 12'
		pic2 = '2x2 dot @ 12, 13' => 'moving dot @ 12, 13'

workflow
	1) single-frame training creates a noun domain
	2) multi-frame training creates a verb domain
	3a) running pic against single-frame search tests against all noun domains, outputting a response of highest percent guess
	3b) single-frame search can be limited by context (3d image, 2d image)
	4a) running pic against multi-frame search tests against all verb domains, outputting a response of highest percent guess
	4b) multi-frame search can be limited by context (3d image gets closer, 2d image gets bigger)
	5) user can confirm or deny correctness of guess or maybe create a new domain

search-algorithm
	1) contrasting - turn pic into 3 grayscale images (r, g, b);
	2) segmentation - segment 16 by 16 image into groups of connected blocks
	3) reduction - consider fourrier transform or other forms of reducing the number of inputs into a piecewise function (PCA, LDA)
	4) individual analysis of each segment
	5) contextual analysis of each segment based on other segments
