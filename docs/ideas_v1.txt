top down 2d
with different types of 2d squares
2d squares give you resources
resources can be used to build different types of squares

point of the game-

train minion(s) to stay alive
each level applies different obstacles or more minions

3 different types of actions
******************************

move away from a dangerous square (causes net energy to be lost)
move toward and gather a resource square (causes net energy to be gained)
place the resouce to create an obstacle to the threat

3 types of logic
*****************
determine optimal place to set a block, 2 blocks, 3 blocks... 
determine best action: place a block, move toward benefit, move away from threat.
internal resource management and planning: test future moves and store patterns that are beneficial

language processing
********************
minion can learn to speak by user typing something and then having minion receive click commands - parsing those commands into a set of instructions - the minion can eventually be trained to act based on the speach alone

listening to instructions that cause it to gain energy (maybe even more than it planned) will cause it to react to those instructions in the future
